# Crypto Challenges

This repo is a backup of the Matasano/Cryptopals Crypto Challenges located at http://cryptopals.com. I had absolutely nothing to do with the creation or maintenance of these challenges. I simply heard about them, began completing them, and wanted to have a copy of them for offline use.

Because the links use absolute paths, you need to run a local web server to serve the files if you want to navigate the pages in your browser. There are a lot of ways to do this. Perhaps the easiest one, if you have Python v2 installed, is to go to the root of this repo in your terminal and run:

```sh
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
